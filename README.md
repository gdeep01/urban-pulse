# Urban Pulse 🏙️

**Urban Pulse** is a real-time city intelligence dashboard that helps you visualize traffic, weather, and public sentiment in one place. I built this to explore how different data streams can come together in an interactive map experience.

- **Smart Insights**: An "Urban Pulse" score that combines traffic, weather, and sentiment into a simple metric.
- **Predictive Engine**: Tries to forecast near-term city conditions using historical data.
- **City Search**: Easily fly to different locations and get instant analytics.
